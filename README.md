# ABC Analysis for Inventory Management

In this project, I want to demonstrate my ability to perform ABC analysis to segment customers using SQL. The analysis is done in Excel. 

## Description of Dataset

Global Super Store is a fictional dataset, which contains data on around 50000 orders placed from the year 2011 to 2014. Source: https://powerbidocs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Global-Superstore.csv

## ABC Analysis

ABC analysis is a common method used by many companies to organize their products effectively. It helps decide on prices and which products to keep in stock.

Products are sorted into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A includes the best-selling products, while Group C has the least popular ones. Then, decisions are made about what to do with each group, like whether to stop selling a product, run a special promotion, or change how it's displayed.

An important thing to remember is that it's best to use multiple factors when doing ABC analysis, not just one. For example, a product might sell a lot but not make much money because it's expensive to produce. Or another product might not sell as much but still bring in a lot of profit because it's cheaper to make.

Additionally, the Pareto principle is often applied in conjunction with ABC analysis. In the context of inventory management, it implies that around 80% of sales typically come from about 20% of products.

In this project, I'm only looking at one factor – how much money each product makes – just to show how the project works. The results of this analysis align with the Pareto principle, highlighting the disproportionate impact of a select few products on overall sales performance.
